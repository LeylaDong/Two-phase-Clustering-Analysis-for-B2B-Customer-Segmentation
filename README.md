# Two-phase-Clustering-Analysis-for-B2B-Customer-Segmentation

In general, customer segmentation is defined as the process where customers of an enterprise are divided into groups based on their purchasing behavior and characteristics. 

The project performs a B2B customer segmentation based on a variation of one of the most common segmentation techniques, referred to as the Length, Recency, Frequency, Monetary (LRFM) model. In addition to performing the LRFM analysis, customers are clustered into groups using the k-means++ clustering algorithm.
